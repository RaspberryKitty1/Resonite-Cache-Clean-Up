# Resonite-Cache-Clean-Up

A collection of scripts to help clean up cache files from the game **Resonite**.

Originally created by an unknown developer for **NeosVR**, the script was designed to remove outdated cache files. This project ports that original PowerShell script into Python and JavaScript to offer broader compatibility and ease of use.

## üìÅ Cache Directories

These scripts target the following Resonite cache locations:

- `%AppData%\LocalLow\Yellow Dog Man Studios\Resonite\Assets`
- `%LocalAppData%\Temp\Yellow Dog Man Studios\Resonite\Cache`

These locations may contain large or outdated files over time, especially if you've been using Resonite heavily. This cleanup helps reclaim space and improve performance.
